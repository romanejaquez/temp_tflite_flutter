# On-Device ML using Flutter and TensorFlow Lite

![](tfliteflutter1.png)

This is a companion repo for the Medium tutorial on On-Device ML in Flutter with Tensorflow Lite, where we build a Flutter app that consumes a pre-trained model trained in Google Colab, and loaded onto a Flutter app for an on-device ML experience. The trained model converts a supplied Celsius degree into Fahrenheit.

This is the schematics of what we accomplished in this Flutter app:

This is what you should expect at the end of the project:
